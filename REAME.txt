A Matlab demo of Gibbs sampling for LDA learning
2009.08.30

learn_GibbsLDA.m implements the function to learn LDA parameters using Gibbs sampling
The equations of the conditional posterior is based on the technical note by Yi Wang,
"Gibbs Sampling and Latent Diriclet Allocation: The Gritty Details ", 
available from http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangyi/lda/index.html

gen_images.m contains the codes to generate the graphical example as in the paper
"Finding scientific topics" by T. L. Griffiths and M. Steyvers, 2004.

dirrnd.m implements the sampling from a Dirichlet distribution.

run_GibbsLDA.m is main code to call to run the demo.
